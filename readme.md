# Top priorities

- Visual legibility
- Speed of data entry

# Todo

- Make an input that can take either a email, phone number, or address
- needs to take 'acceptable types" in as an input â€“ form needs to only take one of each type
- detect email/phone/address with regex
- if address, switch to a textarea that expands in size as necessary
